(Leave this blank for now. Here's an outline of course topics for your reference.)

\section{Mathematical concepts}

\subsection{Logic, truth tables, and DeMorgan's laws}

\subsubsection{Logical Statements}
\begin{definition}
    A logical statement is a statement that can either be \textbf{true} or \textbf{false}. 
    Logical statements must be unambiguous, meaning all ratioal agents with access 
    to the same information will come to the same conclusion. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    ``The sun rose today.'' is a \textbf{true} logical statement.
\end{example}

\begin{proof}
    We begin by observing that the we can currently see the sun in the sky and 
    that we could not see the sun in the sky last night. If we can not see the 
    sun in the sky, it must be below the horizon. Because the sun follows a 
    continuous path, and it had been below the horizon last night, 
    it must have crossed the horizon at some point between last night and now. 
    Thus the sun must have risen today.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Logical Connectives:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[Disjunction:] {
            the disjunction of two statements \(P\) and \(Q\) denoted \(P \lor Q\)
            is true when either \(P\) or \(Q\) or both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. 
        }

        \item[Conjunction:] {
            the conjunction of two statements \(P\) and \(Q\) denoted \(P \land Q\) 
            is true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. 

        }

        \item[Negation:] {
            the negation of a statement \(P\) denoted \(\neg P\) is true when 
            \(P\) is false. 
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Truth Tables}
\begin{definition}
    Certain logical statements' \textbf{truth value} depends on the truth of 
    other statements. For example, ``the sun rose today \textbf{and} it rained 
    today'' requires both statements to be true in order for the overall statements 
    to be true. If the sun rose but it didn't rain, or if the sun hasn't risen 
    but it is raining, the overall statement is false. Thus, to visualize this 
    relationship, it is useful to have a table to lay out the possibilities. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \(A = \) the sun rose today, \(B = \) it rained today.
    \[
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        A & B & $A \land B$ \\
        \hline
        T & T & T \\
        T & F & F \\
        F & T & F \\
        F & F & F \\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \]
\end{example}

\subsubsection{DeMorgan's Laws}
\begin{definition}
    Logical statements and their combinations have their own form of algebra.  One of the fundamental rules are DeMorgan's Laws, which state how to find the complements of conjunctions and disjunctions.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{prop:de-morgans-laws}
    DeMorgan's Laws:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( \neg(A \land B) = \neg A \lor \neg B\)
        \item \( \neg(A \lor B) = \neg A \land \neg B\)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Sets}

\begin{definition}
    Set: An unordered collection of unique elements. 
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Unions, intersections, complements, and set differences}

\begin{definition}
    Union: the union of two sets \(A\), \(B\) is the set that contain elements that are 
    in \(A\), or in \(B\), or both. 
    \[A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B \}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Intersection: the intersection of two sets \(A\), \(B\) is the set that contains 
    elements that are in both \(A\) and \(B\) at the same time.
    \[A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Difference: the set difference of two sets \(A\), \(B\) is the set that contains 
    all elements of \(A\) that are not in \(B\). This operation is not commutative.`'
    \[A \setminus B = \{x \mid x\in A \land x \not\in B\}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Complement: the complement of a set \(A\) is the set of all elements that are 
    not in \(A\). For the complements of a set to be defined, it must be a subset 
    of the unversal set \(\mathcal{U}\). In other words, it is the set difference
    between \(\mathcal{U }\) and \(A\).
    \[A^c = \mathcal{U} \setminus A.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{def:de-morgans-sets}
    DeMorgan's Laws for Sets:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( (A \cap B)^c =  A^c \cup  B^c\)
        \item \( (A \cup B)^c =  A^c \cap  B^c\)
    \end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:generalized-demorgan}

    For all integers \(n \ge 2\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\left( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap ... \cap A_n^c \)
        \item \(\left( A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cup A_2^c \cup ... \cup A_n^c \)
    \end{enumerate}

\end{proposition}

\subsubsection{Venn diagrams}

\begin{definition}
    Venn diagrams: a visual aid for understanding sets of objects and their 
    relationships.

    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Numbers and number systems}

\begin{definition}
    Number: values that symbolize quantities. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Number system: way of representing numbers. Some are more sophisticated than 
    others.
\end{definition}
\subsubsection{Parity, divisibility, and modular arithmetic}

\begin{definition}
    Divisibility: a number \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\) is divisible by another number 
    \(m\) if and only if \(n = k \times m\) for some integer \(k\). 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Parity: the property of a number being even or odd. The number is even if it
    is divisible by two, and odd otherwise. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:modular-arithmetic}
    Modular arithmetic: a number system that groups numbers into equivalence 
    classes based on their remainder when divided by a specific integer. 

    More formally, for integers \(n \), \(r \), and \(m \), we say \(n \) is 
    \textbf{congruent} to \(r \) modulo \(m \) if \((n-r)\) is divisible by \(m\).
    \[n \equiv r \pmod{m} \Leftrightarrow m \mid (n - r)\]

    For example, \(5 \equiv 11 \pmod3\) since they both have a remainder 2 when 
    divided by 3, and because \(11 - 5 = 6\) is divisible by 3.

    Standard arithmetic operations \(+, -, \text{and } \times \) are well-defined
    under modular arithmetic. However, \(\div\) is not always well defined. These 
    operations work the same way as they do in standard arithmetic.

    Notice that the parity of a number is equivalent to its divisability by 2, and 
    a number's divisibility by \(m \in \mathbb{N} > 0\) is a equivalent to it being 
    congruent to \(0\) modulo \(m\). 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:modular-arithmetic1}
    If \(a \equiv b \pmod m\), then \(b \equiv a \pmod m \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:modular-arithmetic2}
    If \(a \equiv a' \pmod m \) and \(b \equiv b' \pmod m\), then: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(a + b \equiv a' + b' \pmod m \)
        \item \(a - b \equiv a' - b' \pmod m \)
        \item \(a \times b \equiv a' \times b' \pmod m \)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\subsubsection{Rational and irrational numbers}

\begin{definition}
    Rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\): the set of numbers that can be expressed 
    as a ratio of two integers.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Irrational numbers: the set of numbers that can't be expressed as a ratio 
    of two integers. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:sqrt2-irrational}
    \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational. 
\end{proposition}


\subsubsection{Real numbers, absolute value, and inequalities}

\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Combinatorics: combinations, permutations, and factorials.}

\begin{definition}
    Combinations \(C(n, r)\): the cardinality of the set of all subsets of a specific cardinality.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Permutations \(P(n, r)\): the cardinality of the set of all orderings of a specific length.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Factorial: the product of natural numbers before it down to zero.
    \[5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 .\]
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Countable sets}
\begin{definition}
    Countable set: a set that is either finite, or that has the same cardinality as 
    natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\). The second case is called \textbf{countably infinite}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The cartesian product of two countable sets will always be countable. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:Q-countable}
    \todo{Prove this wtih existence and uniqueness}
    \(\mathbb{Q }\) is countably infinite. 
\end{proposition}

\subsubsection{Uncountable sets}
\begin{definition}
    Uncountable set: a set that is infinite and there does not exists a bijection 
    from it to the natural numbers.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:R-uncountable}
    \(\mathbb{R }\) is not countably infinite.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Relations and functions}

\subsubsection{Relations and equivalence relations}

\begin{definition}
    Relation \(R\): a set of ordered pairs that represents if a two element \(a, b \in S\) 
    are related. \(a \text{and} b\) are related if and only if \((a,b) \in R\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Reflexive: a relation \(R\) on set \(S\) is reflexive if and only if for 
    every element \(s \in S\), \(sRs\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Symmetric: a relation \(R\) on set \(S\) is symmetric if and only if for 
    every pair of elements \(s_1, s_2 \in S\), \(s_1Rs_2\) implies \(s_2Rs_1\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Transitive: a relation \(R\) on set \(S\) is transitive if and only if for 
    every trio of elements \(s_1, s_2, s_3 \in S\), \(s_1Rs_2\) and \(s_2R_s3\) 
    implies \(s_1Rs_3\). 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Equivalence relations: a special type of relation on a set that satisfies 
    the properties of being symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Congruence under modular arithmetic is an equivalence relation. 
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Functions}

\begin{definition}
    Function: a mapping from a set called the domain to elements in a set called 
    the codomain. 
\end{definition}


\subsubsection{Injections (one-to-one), surjections (onto), and bijections}

\begin{definition}
    Injection: a function \(f: A \rightarrow B\) is injective if and only if 
    every distinct element \(a \in A\) maps to a distinct element \(f(a) \in B\).
    In other words, there does not exist a pair of elements \(a, a' \in A\) where 
    \(a \not= a'\) such that \(f(a) = f(a')\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Surjection: a function \(f: A \rightarrow B \) is surjective if and only if 
    for every element \(b \in B \), there exists \(a \in A \) such that 
    \(f(a) = b\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Bijection: a function \(f: A \rightarrow B \) is a bijection if and only if 
    it is both injective and surjective. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:bijection-cardinality}
    If a bijection \(f: A \rightarrow B\) exists, then \(|A| = |B|\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:cardinality-bijection}
    If \(|A| = |B|\), then a bijection \(f: A \rightarrow B\) exists.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
    A bijection \(f: A \rightarrow B\) exists if and only if \(|A| = |B|\).
\end{theorem}

\section{Proof techniques}

\subsection{Direct Proofs}
\begin{definition}
    Direct proof: using fundamental rules of logic to prove a statement. The 
    fundamental rules of logic are taken for granted as \textbf{axioms}.
\end{definition}

Prove \cref{prop:modular-arithmetic1}.
\begin{proof}
    Assume that \(a \equiv b \pmod m \). This means that \(m \mid (a - b)\).
    Thus, \(a - b = k m \) for some \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\).

    If we multiply both sides by \(-1\), we get \(b - a = -km\). 
    
    Thus, by definition, \(m \mid (b - a)\) and \(b \equiv a \pmod m\).
\end{proof}

\todo[inline, color=red!50]{Feedback requested. [How is this formatting? Does this count as 3 proofs?]}
Using the properties of modular arithmetic in  \cref{def:modular-arithmetic},
prove \cref{prop:modular-arithmetic2}

Given \(a \equiv a' \pmod m \) and \(b \equiv b' \pmod m \):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        \(a + b \equiv a' + b' \pmod{m}\).

        \begin{proof}
            We begin with by defining \(a \equiv a' \pmod{m}\) as \(m \mid (a - a')\).
            Similarly, \(m \mid (b - b')\).

            Following from these definitions, we write:
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
                a - a' = m \times k_1
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
                b - b' = m \times k_2
            \end{equation}

            We can add equations \cref{eq:1} and \cref{eq:2} together to get 
            \(a + b - a' - b' = m \times k_1 + m \times k_2\).

            With some factoring, we get \((a + b) - (a' + b') = m (k_1 + k_2)\).

            By definition, we find that \(m \mid (a + b) - (a' + b')\), and thus
            \(a + b \equiv a' + b' \pmod{m}\).
        \end{proof}
    }

    \item {
        \(a - b \equiv a' - b' \pmod{m}\).

        \begin{proof}
            Following from Proof 1, we can instead subtract equation \cref{eq:1}
            and \cref{eq:2} to get 
            \\ \(a - b - a' + b' = m \times k_1 - m \times k_2\).

            With some factoring, we get \((a-b) - (a'-b') = m(k_1 - k_2)\).

            By definition, we find that \(m \mid (a - b) - (a' - b')\), and thus
            \(a - b \equiv a' - b' \pmod{m}\).
        \end{proof}
    }

    \item {
        \(a \times b \equiv a' \times b' \pmod{m}\).

        \begin{proof}
            Following from equation \cref{eq:1}, we get 
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
                a = a' + m \times k_1.
            \end{equation}
            Similarly, from equation \cref{eq:2}, we  get 
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
                b = b' + m \times k_2.
            \end{equation}

            By multiplying equations \cref{eq:3} and \cref{eq:4}, we get 
            \(a \times b = (a' + m\times k_1) (b' + m\times k_2)\).

            \textit{From now on, I will omit the \(\times\) symbol.}

            By distributing, we get 
            \[ab = a'b' + a'mk_2 + b'mk_1 + m^2k_1k_2.\]
            
            We can factor out \(m\) to find 
            \[ab = a'b' + m(a'k_2 + b'k_1 + mk_1k_2).\]

            We can subtract \(a'b'\) from both sides to find 
            \[ab - a'b' = m(a'k_2 + b'k_1 + mk_1k_2).\]

            By definition, we see that \(m \mid (ab - a'b')\), and, by extension, 
            \(ab \equiv a'b' \pmod{m}\).
                
        \end{proof}
    }
\end{enumerate}

    an element exists with a given property, and that it is the only element that 
    exhibits such property. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Proof by Induction}

\begin{definition}
    Proof by Induction: proof technique used to prove a statement is true for  
    a countably infinite set of discrete elements. 

    When doing proofs by induction, it is useful to enumerate the cases as 
    \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). This proof begins with a \textbf{base case} (or in some 
    scenarios \textbf{base cases}) proving that the 
    proposition is true for some ``small'' cases. Typically this means proving 
    the proposition is true for \(n = 0, 1, 2\). It is also helpful to ``play''
    to gain intuition about our problem before proceding to the inductive step. 

    We then form an \textbf{inductive hypothesis} that assumes our proposition is true for 
    cases \(n \le k\). Our \textbf{inductive step} is to prove that this assumption 
    necessarily means that the \(n = k+1\) case must be true. 

    Thus, the cases \(n\) up to \(k\) implies case \(n = k + 1\). So, starting at 
    our base case, we know that \(n = 0\) is true. Then we know that \(n = 1\) is true. 
    Since, cases \(n=0\) and \(n=1\) are true, case \(n=2\) is true. Then since 
    cases \(0 \le n \le 2\) are true, case \(n = 3\) is true, and so on.

    Now, it may seem that this proof is circular at first, since we are making a 
    massive assumption in the form of our inductive hypothesis. However, our 
    assumption is not the same as our conclusion. Our inductive hypothesis is 
    used to prove that for any case \(n = k\), its successor must be true. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \Cref{prop:generalized-demorgan} can be proven with induction.

    For the first case, we have
    \[\left( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap ... \cap A_n^c.\]
    \begin{proof}
        First, we define some useful notation for a union and intersection
        for a large series of sets \(A_1, A_2, ..., A_3\):
        \[ \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n\]
        \[ \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n.\]

        First, we use \cref{def:de-morgans-sets} (DeMorgan's Law for Sets)
        as the base case \(n=2\),
        \(\left( A_1 \cup A_2 \right)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c.\)

        Then, as our inductive hypothesis, we assume that 
        \[ \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c, \text{ for } n \le k.\]

        Then, we see that for \(n+1\), 
        \begin{align*}
            \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \cup A_{n+1} \right)^c \\
            \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c \cap A_{n+1}^c .\\
        \end{align*}

        We can use our inductive hypothesis to substitute 
        \(\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c\)
        to get,
        \begin{align*}
            \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c \cap A_{n+1}^c .\\
            &= A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap ... \cap A_n^c \cap A_{n+1}^c .\\
        \end{align*}

        Therefore, 
        \[\left( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap ... \cap A_n^c \]
        for any integer \(n \ge 2\).
    \end{proof}

    Similarly, for the second case, we have 
    \[\left( A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cup A_2^c \cup ... \cup A_n^c.\]
    \begin{proof}
        First, we use \cref{def:de-morgans-sets} (DeMorgan's Law for Sets)
        as the base case \(n=2\),
        \(\left( A_1 \cap A_2 \right)^c = A_1^c \cup A_2^c.\)

        Then, as our inductive hypothesis, we assume that 
        \[ \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c, \text{ for } n \le k.\]

        Then, we see that for \(n+1\), 
        \begin{align*}
            \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i \cap A_{n+1} \right)^c \\
            \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c \cup A_{n+1}^c .\\
        \end{align*}

        We can use our inductive hypothesis to substitute 
        \(\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)^c = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c\)
        to get,
        \begin{align*}
            \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n+1} A_i \right)^c &= \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i^c \cup A_{n+1}^c .\\
            &= A_1^c \cup A_2^c \cup ... \cup A_n^c \cup A_{n+1}^c .\\
        \end{align*}

        Therefore, 
        \[\left( A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n \right)^c = A_1^c \cup A_2^c \cup ... \cup A_n^c \]
        for any integer \(n \ge 2\).
    \end{proof}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
        Let \(F_n\) be the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number, where \(F_0 = F_1 = 1\)
        and \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\). Prove that \(F_n \le 1.9^n\) for all
        \(n \ge 1\).

    \begin{proof}
        We proceed by induction, starting with the base cases, where \(n=1,2\):
        \[n = 1, F_1 = 1 \le 1.9^1 = 1.9\]
        \[n = 2, F_2 = 2 \le 1.9^2 = 3.61.\]

        We assume as an inductive hypothesis that \(F_n \le 1.9^n\) for \(1 \le n \le k\).

        Using our inductive hypothesis, we see that \(F_k \le 1.9^k\)
        and \(F_{k-1} \le 1.9^{k-1}\).
        % \[F_{k+1} \le 1.9^{k+1}\]
        % \[F_k + F_{k-1} \le 1.9^{k+1}.\]

        So, \(F_k + F_{k-1} \le 1.9^k + 1.9^{k-1}\).

        By refactoring \(1.9^k + 1.9^{k-1}\), we get:
        \[1.9^k + 1.9^{k-1} = 1.9(1.9^{k-1}) + 1.9^{k-1} = 2.9(1.9^{k-1}).\]

        Also, \(1.9^{k+1}\) can be rewritten as \(1.9^2 (1.9^{k-1}) = 3.61(1.9^{k-1})\).

        Finally, we see
        \[F_{k+1} = F_k + F_{k-1} \le 2.9(1.9^{k-1}) \le 3.61(1.9^{k-1}) = 1.9^{k+1}\]
        \[F_{k+1} \le 1.9^{k+1}.\]

        Thus, we conclude that by the principle of mathematical induction, 
        \(F_n \le 1.9^n\) for all \(n \ge 1\).
    \end{proof}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Look up the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Prove that given a stack of 
    disks, you can solve the puzzle in moves.

    \begin{proof}
        We begin by defining the Tower of Hanoi problem. 
        
        In this problem, we begin 
        with a stack of \(n\) disks. The disks are ordered from largest at the bottom 
        to smallest at the top. We are also given 3 `spots' to place our disks under 
        one condition: that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk. 

        Following these rules, what is the minimum number of moves required to move
        the entire pile to a new `spot'?
        
        We define the function \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) such that it 
        maps the starting stack height \(n\) to the minimum number of moves required 
        to move the entire pile \(f(n)\).

        Before immediately proving that \(f(n) = 2^n - 1\), it is more intuitive to 
        first define \(f\) as a recurrence relation, then prove that the recurrence
        relation is equal to \(2^n -1\).

        We notice that moving the entire pile  of \(n\) disks essentially requires 3 `phases':
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Moving the top \(n-1\) disks onto a single pile.
            \item Moving the \(n\)th disk to another vacant spot.
            \item Moving the top \(n-1\) disks onto the new spot.
        \end{enumerate}

        Thus, we know that \(f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 + f(n-1) = 1 + 2f(n-1)\), where \(f(1) = 1\).
        We can then prove \(f(n) = 2^n -1\) using induction. 

        We begin with our base cases:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{c c}
                \(n\)   & \(f(n)\) \\
                \hline \\
                1       & \(1 = 2^1 - 1\)\\
                2       & \(3 = 2^2 - 1\) \\
                3       & \(7 = 2^3 - 1\) \\
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

        Now, we assume that \(f(k) = 2^k -1 \) for all \(1 \le k \le n\).
        
        We see that
        \[f(k+1) = 1 + 2f(k)\]
        \[f(k+1) = 1 + 2(2^k - 1)\]
        \[f(k+1) = 2^{k+1} - 1.\]

        Thus, \(f(n) = 2^n - 1\).
    \end{proof}
\end{example}

\subsection{Proof by Contradiction}

\begin{definition}
    Proof by contradiction: proof technique that assumes the opposite of 
    our proposition, then showing that this leads to an absurd conclusion,
    ie. a contradiction. Used as a ``last resort'' proof technique. 

    This proof works because all statements in our mathematical universe can 
    either be true or false. Thus, by assuming the opposite of our proposition, 
    and showing that the opposite of our proposition \textbf{can not} be true, 
    our original proposition then \textbf{must} be true. We show that the 
    opposite of our proposition can't be true through finding a contradiction.

    This proof technique is used as a last resort since it doesn't necessarily
    tell you much abou why/how our proposition is true, just that it must be true. 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \Cref{prop:R-uncountable} can be proven by contradiction. This is the famous 
    Cantor's diagonalization argument. 

    First we assume that \(\mathbb{R}\) is countably infinite. In other words, 
    \(|\mathbb{R}| = |\mathbb{N}|\), and that there exists a bijection between 
    \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{N}\).

    Thus, we can list out all the real numbers \(r_i \in \mathbb{R}\) for \(i \in \mathbb{N}\)
    in a table as follows where the rows are distinct real numbers \(r_i\) and the 
    columns are their decimal places:
    \[
\begin{array}{r|ccccccc}
      & 10^{-1} & 10^{-2} & 10^{-3} & 10^{-4} & 10^{-5} & \cdots \\ \hline
r_{1} & \mathbf{a_{11}} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
r_{2} & a_{21} & \mathbf{a_{22}} & a_{23} & a_{24} & a_{25} & \cdots & a_{2n}\\
r_{3} & a_{31} & a_{32} & \mathbf{a_{33}} & a_{34} & a_{35} & \cdots & a_{3n}\\
r_{4} & a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & \mathbf{a_{44}} & a_{45} & \cdots & a_{4n}\\
r_{5} & a_{51} & a_{52} & a_{53} & a_{54} & \mathbf{a_{55}} & \cdots & a_{5n}\\
\vdots     & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
r_{n} & a_{n1} & a_{n2} & a_{n3} & a_{n4} & a_{n5} & \cdots & \mathbf{a_{nn}}\\
\vdots     & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}
\]

    Then, we see the bolded diagonal. With this diagonal, for each \(a_{jj}\) for 
    \(j \in \mathbb{N}\), we can construct an \textbf{entirely new} real number 
    just be changing \(a_{jj}\). In the original arument, Cantor states to add 1 
    if \(a_{jj} < 9\) and to subtract 1 if \(a_{jj} = 9\). However a more general 
    way of saying this is to just pick a new integer \(0 \le a_{jj}' \le 9\)
    that is not equal to \(a_{jj}\).

    So, we have now constructed a new real number, contradicting our assumption. 
    Thus, we see that \(\mathbb{R}\) must not be countably infinite.
\end{example}
