\begin{proof}
    % Should use the \(\) because its good practice.
    Since \(a\) is odd, we can write $a$ as \(a = 2m + 1\) for some integer \(m\).
    Likewise, we can write \(b = 2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\). 
    \\ Therefore,
    \[
        a + b = 2m + 1 + 2k + 1 = 2(m + k + 1),
    \]
    where \(m + k + 1\) is an integer, since adding integers results in an integer.
    Thus \(a + b\) is even.

\end{proof}
